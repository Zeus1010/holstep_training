### After downloading the file make sure that you have installed all necessary packages.
There are two python files, both implementing two different models :
1. Basic 2 Layered Convolutional Neural Network
2. Basic 2 Layered Convolutional Neural Network along with LSTM

### For implementing the first model(cnn), type in the following command :
```
python3 model_1.py 
```
### For implementing the second model(cnn_lstm), type in the following command :
```
python3 model_2.py 
```
